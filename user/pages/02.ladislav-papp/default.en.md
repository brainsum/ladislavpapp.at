# Ladislav Papp {.page__title}

Harpist Ladislav Papp was born in Bratislava, Slovakia, on 1 November 1979.
He studied at the Bratislava Conservatory in the class of Prof. Ludmila
Sawiczová.
His first big success was winning first prize at the international competition
in Vienna in 1998.

It was not only the prize that was decisive for his future career, but also the acquaintance with the world-renowned harp maker Victor Salvi.

With the financial support of Mr Salvi, Ladislav Papp could continue his studies
at the Zurich Conservatory in the class of Prof. Catherine Michel. He also
received a scholarship from the Kiwanis Club of Zurich because of his successful studies.
In 2003, he successfully completed his studies by attaining his higher education diploma.

In the same year, Ladislav worked as a solo harpist at the Darmstadt State Opera and he was also admitted to the master class of Prof. Xavier de Maistre in
Hamburg, where he trained further as an artist.
Since 2004 he has been a member of the Stage Orchestra of the Vienna State Opera and a permanent substitute for the Vienna Philharmonic at the same time.
Ladislav has also tirelessly devoted himself to chamber music in the duo with
his wife, flutist Justina Papp.

He not only appeared as a soloist in Slovakia (Bratislavské hudobné Slavností),
but he also took part in other major events and festivals in Prague, Budapest
and Geneva.

Ladislav Papp brought his first CD out in 1999, titled “Harp is my No.1”.
